1. The int temp does not need to be a pointer. 
2. f((a+2), 4)
3. You create the array on the stack and when the method goes out of scope so does the array. Creating on the heap would solve this usisng the 'new' keyword
4. The null terminator is missing from the end of the string. increase array length by one and add string[5] = '\0';
