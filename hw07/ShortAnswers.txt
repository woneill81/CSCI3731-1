1) The friend keyword allows for a class to grant an object access to private data
2) You will end up importing the namespace of all c++ files  with that header, you then cannot use namespaces to avoid name collisions
3) heap memory managemant is hard because you have to delete the memory but if you have multiple pointers you cant delete an object twice
4) the conventional way to keep track of large amounts of heap data is to create an object that owns each pointer an is responsible for deleting it accordingly.
5) The three ways that a class can contain an object is using a pointer, a reference, and an actual object
6) A forward delaration tells the program that something exists without specifying details on it until later. This is needed to two header files dont call each other back anf forth indefinitely.
