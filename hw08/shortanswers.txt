1) the rule of 5 states that if a class contains one of the following it should contain all 5: 
	a) destructor
	b) copy constructor
	c) copy assignment operator
	d) move constructor
	e) move assignment constructor
2) A copy preserves the original object while a move overwrites it and deletes it
3) A compiling technique that eliminates or 'omits' the unncessecary copying of objects
4) Smart pointers are overloaded pointer operators that are classes that contain other pointers
5) You can prevent someone from copying a class you wrote by using this line of code: 
	"Thing& operator=(const Thing& thing) = delete;" and overloading the operator
