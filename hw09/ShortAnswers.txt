1) upcasting if refering to an object as a superclass, downcasting is making an object back into a subclass
2) mark a method as virtual if a subclass will overwrite the method, virtual slows down code so dont use unless you have to
3) dynamic cast looks at the type of object and checks if its valid. static casting doesnt check on the object until runtime. static is used for speed.
4) const casting is useful when a library method is not marked as const but your object is. using const cast allows the object to be manipulated.
5) passing the banana into the first method will allow the banana to get manipulated but when u pass into the second method the object can not be changed although it is not a const object
6) in Java every class has a single parent while in C++ any number of parents are allowed. Java uses interfaces to allow for this to be changed but c++ does not need this to work.
