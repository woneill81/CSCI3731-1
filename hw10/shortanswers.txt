1)All classes in Java only have one superclass and can only call from the object class. In c++ you are allowed to have multiple inheritance
2) With a template you can build objects with different types of data but have the same class structure 
3) Some drawbacks to templates include the slow compilation because the compiler creates the methods for each instantiation. you also can not cast a template to another one.
4) An iterator is a class that takes a current element and allows the user to step into the next element onward
